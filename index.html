        <div style="text-align:center"> <h1>  Isreal's War in Gaza </h1> 
        <p> <b>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu</b> has told families of the remaining Israeli <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68035744">hostages</a> in <a href="https://www.cnn.com/middleeast/live-news/israel-hamas-war-gaza-news-01-22-24/index.html"> Gaza</a> that Israel has an “initiative” to secure the release of those abducted – but there is “no real proposal” from <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2024/1/22/how-israel-has-repeatedly-rejected-hamas-truce-offers"> Hamas</a> that would advance their freedom.</p>
    
        <p> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/01/22/israel-hamas-war-news-gaza-palestine-updates/"> Isreali</a> <i>forces appeared to ramp up ground</i> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2024/01/israel-south-africa-genocide-case-fake-quotes/677198/">flocal media</a> and eyewitnesses, forcing a mass exodus of residents from southwestern Gaza further inland. For more than a month now, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/22/briefing/israel-gaza-war-death-toll.html">Biden administration</a> and other allies of Israel have been urging its leaders to scale back the war in Gaza. A more targeted battle plan, these allies have said, could reduce civilian casualties while still weakening Hamas. Some Israeli officials have made the same argument. </p>
        
        <ol>Over the past week, an average of 151 Gazans, including both Hamas fighters and civilians, have died each day. </ol>
        <ol> the death toll in Gaza remains high, and some of the victims continue to be civilians, including children. </ol>
        <ol> fewer than 50 Gazans (including Hamas militants) were killed each day on average during a 50-day war in 2014.</ol>
